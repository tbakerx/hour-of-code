# Hour of Code

![Login-Screenshot](screenshot.png?raw=true "Login Page Screenshot")

This is a React Native mobile app for developers to commit to coding for at least an hour a day.

From entry-level coders to seasoned professionals learning a new discipline and everything in between, I agree that the best way to learn is to code for at least an hour a day. I am employing this technique myself during my post-University travels in preparation for starting my software development career, and have been seeing immense improvement in speed of learning and general confidence in my abilities.

### Purpose of the app:
The purpose of this app (besides being a means to hone skills in React Native) is to give a place to log and keep track of your "hours of code". The hope is that it will be useful for developers to stay motivated and consistent on learning.

### Intended (and upcoming) Features:
* Allow a user to log how long they coded on a given day, and what they accomplished
* Allow the user an overview of when they succeeded and how often they succeed
* Allow the user to set a gentle notification reminder to work if they haven't logged anything that day
